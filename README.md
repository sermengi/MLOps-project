# MLOps Project

Welcome to the **MLOps Project** repository! This project is dedicated to exploring and implementing the full lifecycle of a machine learning project, from initial design to final deployment.

## Overview

The MLOps Project aims to bridge the gap between machine learning and operations, ensuring a streamlined and efficient process for delivering ML solutions. This repository serves as a hands-on space to experiment with various tools, workflows, and best practices in MLOps.

## Goals

- **End-to-End ML Workflow**: Cover every stage of the ML lifecycle, including data preparation, model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring.
- **Experimentation**: Test and refine MLOps practices and tools to optimize the development and deployment pipeline.
- **Learning**: Enhance understanding of MLOps methodologies and share knowledge through practical implementations.

## Key Features

- **Data Pipeline**: Automate data collection, preprocessing, and storage.
- **Model Training**: Implement scalable and reproducible model training pipelines.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Set up continuous integration and deployment pipelines for ML models.
- **Monitoring & Feedback**: Deploy monitoring systems to track model performance and gather feedback for improvement.
